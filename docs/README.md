I am Lucho Suaya, a student of the Bahcelor’s Degree in Video Games by [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca) at [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project II, under the supervisión of lecturers [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu) and [Marc Garrigó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo/).

## Research Organization
As you may see in the index, this page has many sections and many information. It’s possible that you are not interested in everything that is explained here, so to ease your accessibility, let me explain how the research is organized (apart of introduction part).

   1. First of all, in [A* First Improvements, Generalities and Context](#a-first-improvements-generalities-and-context), I explain the main and minor optimizations for A* and I introduce the concept of Incremental Pathfinding as well as explaining a bit the context in which pathfinding evolved. Finally, I go a bit over angled pathfinding.
  
   2. In the second part, [Nowadays - Hierarchies and other Games](#nowadays---hierarchies-and-other-games) I start with the Hierarchical Pathfinding approach to improve A*, which is very used and common nowadays, and for that reason, I put many examples of other games using it (in fact, it’s difficult to find big games that do not use it).
  
   3. In the 3rd and final part, I introduce and develop [My Approach - Killing Path Symmetries](#my-approach-killing-path-symmetries), to improve A*, which is a way to do it developed by an investigator called Daniel Harabor and makes A* way faster. Also, other improvements are explained since JPS might not be the best take for all games, so to have references if it’s your case (although they are not developed as JPS, I put links to works that show how to do it).
  
Then I conclude this research with additional information and final thoughts.
